/// 1. The pair is seeded BEFORE the validating call — a `.bearer` request resolves its
///    `Authorization` header through `BearerTokenStore`, so an unseeded (or, at re-auth, a
///    still-dead) store would send exactly the wrong credentials — but WITHOUT a Keychain
///    hook: an unproven pair may not reach disk, and the validating call can rotate it, so an
///    armed hook would leave a restorable session behind after a sign-in that then failed.
/// 2. A failed validation DRAINS the store rather than leaving credentials the server just
///    rejected wired up for the next request.
/// 3. What gets persisted is what the STORE holds afterwards, never the pre-seed local: the
///    validating call can rotate the pair, and saving the local copy would put the retired
///    refresh token back in the Keychain — which the portal's reuse detection answers by
///    revoking the whole session on the next launch. `attachPersistence` arms the hook and
///    writes that pair in ONE critical section, so a rotation cannot slip between them.
/// 4. A SUPERSEDED OR CANCELLED attempt touches NOTHING — it neither seeds, drains nor
///    persists. The store and the Keychain entry are process-wide, so an abandoned attempt (a
///    second provider tap, an edited server URL, a logout tearing the screen down) that wrote
///    to either would be writing over whatever replaced it. That is not enforced by checking
///    `Task.isCancelled` before each hop — every such check is a window — but by claiming the
///    store for THIS attempt up front and letting the store itself reject every late arrival:
///    see ``BearerStoreClaim``.
