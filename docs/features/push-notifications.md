# Push notifications (#46, #64)

Normative invariants moved out of `CLAUDE.md` (2026-08-14 restructure). The short rules live in
`CLAUDE.md` → "Push notifications"; this doc is the full contract. Architecture detail:
`docs/architecture.md` → Push notifications. Push-tap **approval recovery** lives in
`docs/features/approvals.md`. Design history: `docs/plans/completed/`.

## Three artifacts, three repos

Push notifications span THREE artifacts but only the iOS app lives in this repo: `hermes-push`
(a standalone pip plugin — **hermes-agent is NOT modified**) and the serverless **push gateway**
(holds the `.p8`) live in **separate repos** — plugin: `goncharik/hermes-mobile-push-plugin`
(public); gateway: `goncharik/hermes-mobile-push-gateway` (private, holds the Apple secret).

## Conventions

- **Capability-gate** — the toggle/controls hide when `POST /api/plugins/hermes-push/register`
  404s → `pushAvailable = false` (mirrors attach/profiles).
- **Generic-body privacy rule** — NO message content/args/reasoning/command ever goes in a push;
  only a generic title/body + `session_id` transit the gateway (content is fetched in-app over
  the private net).
- Compile-time **`apns_env`** (`#if DEBUG` → `sandbox`, else `production`) **must match the
  `aps-environment` entitlement** — which is driven **per-build-configuration** via
  `$(APS_ENVIRONMENT)` (Debug → `development`, Release → `production`) in `Project.swift`, NOT a
  static value (Tuist emits the entitlement verbatim with no Xcode export rewrite, so a static
  `development` would ship a sandbox entitlement on Release).
- **Permission is requested on the sessions-list appearance** (right after login), per the
  product decision — NOT first launch.
- **`PushClient` is iOS-only-guarded** like `AudioRecorderClient` (`#if canImport(UIKit)`;
  non-iOS `liveValue = testValue`); keep pure logic (hex, `apnsEnv`, payload parse,
  foreground-suppression) — and `PushBridge` itself (Foundation-only: `NSLock` + `AsyncStream`)
  — outside the guard so the stream/buffer behavior is macOS-tested.

## Persisted intent and remote removal

`notificationPreferenceScope` is the normalized origin plus stable account identity, never
rotating credentials. Cookie and bearer identities are separate; legacy token mode is
server-scoped because it has no stable account identifier. Absent preference preserves
legacy behavior; explicit Off wins over OS authorization, token events and registration.

Off synchronously persists false and a new removal operation before network work. Removal
uncertainty/confirmation is persisted under the same scope. Missing/corrupt removal state
for explicit Off means unconfirmed, never success. Retain only the device routing tokens
needed to retry: a deduplicated scoped list of every unresolved target (a token change adds
the new token, never replaces an unresolved one); it survives logout clearing the global
token. Retry unregisters every retained target; only success for all of them confirms
removal and drops the list. Partial failure keeps the full list for idempotent retry. Identity cleanup never erases intent or unresolved removal.

Settings restores warning/retry after recreation, relaunch and same-account return. A
matching authenticated unregister success alone confirms removal; a stale completion cannot
confirm a newer Off or On intent. Per-scope FIFO registration/unregistration and intent checks
at admission prevent an older register from landing after Off's unregister. Logout cleanup
is a separate five-second, single-use old-origin capability (see `oauth-sign-in.md`); its
best-effort result does not mark pending Settings removal confirmed.

Unconfirmed Off may still receive pushes. Retry is manual while signed into the same scope;
there is no automatic online retry promise. Without any saved device token, show the honest
missing-token warning and direct the user to server-side removal, not an impossible retry.
Personal signing without push entitlements cannot receive remote push; iOS permission alone
cannot enable it. Off does not direct the user to re-enable notifications.

## No shared secret on the device or in the plugin

**The app does NOT sign pushes, and the plugin holds NO shared secret** — the gateway is the
only place the signing key (`HMAC_SECRET`) lives (a single hosted gateway serves all App Store
users, so a plugin-held shared secret would be world-readable). The gateway instead **issues a
device-scoped capability**: `POST /register {device_token} → {capability}` where
`capability = hex(HMAC-SHA256(HMAC_SECRET, "hpc1:"+device_token))`. The plugin fetches it
lazily, caches it per-device in its token store, and presents it on every `POST /push` (which
**requires** `capability` — the old shared-secret `hmac`-over-all-fields is gone), re-fetching
once on a `403 invalid_capability`. A leaked capability can only push to its own device. The iOS
app is unchanged: it still calls the **plugin's** `/register`
(`{device_token, apns_env, app_version}` → `{ok, device_token, apns_env}`, a different endpoint
from the gateway's capability `/register`) and persists no secret (no Keychain push-secret).

## The four triggers

**All four triggers fire via real plugin hooks** (CLI + gateway): approval
(`pre_approval_request`), turn-complete (`post_llm_call`, gated to ~>10s turns via a
`pre_llm_call` start anchor), error (`on_session_end`, genuine failures only — not
success/interrupt), and clarify (`pre_tool_call` filtered to the `clarify` tool, fired before
the user is prompted — not duration-gated).

## Cold-launch tap replay (#46)

A launch-from-push tap is dropped at two independent points unless both are covered:

- `PushBridge` buffers a tap that fires with no **live** `tapStream()` subscriber and the first
  subscriber drains it **consume-once** (cleared after delivery — a stale tap must not
  re-navigate a later re-subscriber, unlike the idempotent `lastToken` replay; terminated
  continuations are pruned via `onTermination`, so a cancelled observer can't strand a dead
  entry that defeats the `isEmpty` buffer gate).
- A tap arriving before `state.home` exists is stashed in `AppFeature.State.pendingPushTap`
  (single stash, last-wins; process-lifetime, cleared on logout, badge bookkeeping unchanged)
  and re-sent as `.pushTapped` when `home` is created (`.autoConnectSucceeded` AND the
  manual-login `.onboarding(.delegate(.connected))`) — always replay through the one #32 routing
  path (slot dedup, approval-hint arming, placeholder `Session(id:)` + `session.resume`), never
  call `openSession` directly.

The stash records the persisted server URL at stash time and a login to a **different** server
drops it (scrubbing its badge entry) instead of replaying — resuming a foreign session id would
trip the resume self-heal into creating a spurious empty chat; an unknown origin (logged out, no
stored URL) replays unverified. Home creation seeds the persisted profile selection
(`makeHomeState`) so the replayed open resumes under the right profile — the replay fires before
the list's `.task` prefs reload.

## Internal agent forks never push (#64)

Plugin-side only — no iOS/gateway change: a `delegate_task`/`curator` child fires the same hooks
mid-parent-turn with `platform == "subagent"`/`"curator"` and its own `session_id`, so the
plugin drops its `complete`/`error` and keeps its id out of the approval turn-tracker; approvals
are never filtered and never carry the parent's id. Only those exact values are filtered
(anything else fails open), and the deny-list may only ever be widened to a fork that owns its
`session_id` — `agent/background_review.py` (inherits the parent's `platform` AND `session_id`)
is the known-unfixed second root cause. The normative contract lives in the plugin's
`triggers.py`.
