// App Intents exposing the app's entry points outside the app (#93): Shortcuts / Siri,
// Spotlight, and the Action button. Home Screen icon long-press Quick Actions are the
// separate UIKit path declared in Project.swift and routed by PushAppDelegate.
//
// All intents are `openAppWhenRun` and only ROUTE — they feed `IntentBridge`, which the
// reducer (`AppFeature.launchIntentReceived`) observes; no agent logic runs from the
// intent (thin-client rule: the socket only lives in the foreground). The bridge is the
// same consume-once pattern as the push-tap bridge (#46), so a launch-from-intent that
// races the store's `.task` observer is buffered, not dropped.
