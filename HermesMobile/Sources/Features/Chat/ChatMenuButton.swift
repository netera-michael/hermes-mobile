/// The chat screen's nav-bar ellipsis menu (Rename / Copy ID / display toggles), split out of
/// `ChatView` so it observes ONLY the fields it renders (#82).
///
/// `ChatView.body` re-evaluates on every streaming change — each `message.delta`, tool
/// start/complete, status update, and thinking tick — because it reads `visibleRows`,
/// `isSending`, and friends. While this menu lived inline in `ChatView`'s `.toolbar { }`,
/// every one of those re-evaluations rebuilt the `Menu` and its label, and the toolbar
/// button replayed its appearance each time; with back-to-back tool calls that is the
/// visible flicker loop the tester reported on the icon.
///
/// As a child view holding the store — a reference, which SwiftUI diffs by identity, so the
/// parent's re-render alone does not re-run this body — Observation re-evaluates it only
/// when the observed state actually changes, i.e. at session creation, a display toggle, and
/// never mid-turn.
///
/// Deliberately takes the STORE rather than `canRename:` / `onRename:` parameters: closure
/// fields are not comparable, so SwiftUI would have to re-run the body on every parent
/// update anyway and the fix would evaporate.
///
/// The display section lives here rather than in the Settings sheet on purpose: these are
/// per-glance reading controls, and the chat's own menu is where a user looks while a turn
/// is burying the reply they're trying to read (#55). The prefs remain device-local and
/// persist immediately.
